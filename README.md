# Capstone Project: MoonBoard

Project description: classifying difficulty of climbing routes on the MoonBoard and generating new ones.

## Dataset
The raw data can be found in the `raw_data` folder, the dataset is `moonGen_scrape_2016_final`. The `data` folder contains the cleaned dataset in csv and pickle format, as well as a notebook of exploratory data analysis steps.

## Running the scripts
The models are in Colab notebooks. You can simply go to the `models` folder and run the notebooks.

## Progress
### Classification
**Done:**
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Random Forrest
- XGBoost
- Simple CNN

**To do:**
- Better CNN
- LSTM

### Generation
**In Progress:**
- Variational Autoencoders

**To do:**
- GANs
